Bugs
* Full struct assignment must be handled differently by individually assigning all variables using the masked move
* A const assigned by an aliased const generates error
    - This is solved by finding the decl_type token for Token_ReadVar

Features
* Explicit struct initialization, allowing for out-of-order init
    - vec3 a = { x = 0, y = var, z =  };
	- vec3 b = { z = 5, x = z };
* Allow const struct? Comes with some philosophical problems
    - Should all members be const as well, or do we only need the values that initialize the struct to be const?
* Const struct members are treated as static, accessable via . operator using struct name and variable name

Error emissions
* Emit error if float is assigned to an int or vice versa
* Verify naming of members and members of members
* Emit error if const/readonly is assigned after init
* Emit error if float value is appended with "f"
