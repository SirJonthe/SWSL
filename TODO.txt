Bugs
* Full struct assignment must be handled differently by individually assigning all variables using the masked move
    - Must be recursive to initialize nested structs
* Accessing struct members

Features
* Explicit struct initialization, allowing for out-of-order init
    - vec3 a = { x = 0, y = var, z =  };
	- vec3 b = { z = 5, x = z };
* Member initialization
    - mutable CAN be initialized at delcaration or in-place (inside struct definition, is automatically emitted when struct is declared unless overridden by explicit init)
	- immutable MUST be initialized at declaration OR in-place
* Const struct is allowed if all initializers are const
* Implement intrinsic functions

Error emissions
* Emit error if float is assigned to an int or vice versa
* Verify naming of members and members of members
* Emit error if const/readonly is not assigned at init
* Emit error if const/readonly is assigned after init
* Emit error if float value is appended with "f"
    - This must be done, as the literal is otherwise interpreted as an alias
